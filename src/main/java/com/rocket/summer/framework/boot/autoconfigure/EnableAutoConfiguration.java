/**
 * Enable auto-configuration of the Spring Application Context, attempting to guess and
 * configure beans that you are likely to need. Auto-configuration classes are usually
 * applied based on your classpath and what beans you have defined. For example, If you
 * have {@code tomcat-embedded.jar} on your classpath you are likely to want a
 * {@link TomcatEmbeddedServletContainerFactory} (unless you have defined your own
 * {@link EmbeddedServletContainerFactory} bean).
 * <p>
 * When using {@link SpringBootApplication}, the auto-configuration of the context is
 * automatically enabled and adding this annotation has therefore no additional effect.
 * <p>
 * Auto-configuration tries to be as intelligent as possible and will back-away as you
 * define more of your own configuration. You can always manually {@link #exclude()} any
 * configuration that you never want to apply (use {@link #excludeName()} if you don't
 * have access to them). You can also exclude them via the
 * {@code spring.autoconfigure.exclude} property. Auto-configuration is always applied
 * after user-defined beans have been registered.
 * <p>
 * The package of the class that is annotated with {@code @EnableAutoConfiguration},
 * usually via {@code @SpringBootApplication}, has specific significance and is often used
 * as a 'default'. For example, it will be used when scanning for {@code @Entity} classes.
 * It is generally recommended that you place {@code @EnableAutoConfiguration} (if you're
 * not using {@code @SpringBootApplication}) in a root package so that all sub-packages
 * and classes can be searched.
 * <p>
 * Auto-configuration classes are regular Spring {@link Configuration} beans. They are
 * located using the {@link SpringFactoriesLoader} mechanism (keyed against this class).
 * Generally auto-configuration beans are {@link Conditional @Conditional} beans (most
 * often using {@link ConditionalOnClass @ConditionalOnClass} and
 * {@link ConditionalOnMissingBean @ConditionalOnMissingBean} annotations).
