/**
 * Callback interface triggered at the end of the singleton pre-instantiation phase
 * during {@link BeanFactory} bootstrap. This interface can be implemented by
 * singleton beans in order to perform some initialization after the regular
 * singleton instantiation algorithm, avoiding side effects with accidental early
 * initialization (e.g. from {@link ListableBeanFactory#getBeansOfType} calls).
 * In that sense, it is an alternative to {@link InitializingBean} which gets
 * triggered right at the end of a bean's local construction phase.
 *
 * <p>This callback variant is somewhat similar to
 * {@link com.rocket.summer.framework.context.event.ContextRefreshedEvent} but doesn't
 * require an implementation of {@link com.rocket.summer.framework.context.ApplicationListener},
 * with no need to filter context references across a context hierarchy etc.
 * It also implies a more minimal dependency on just the {@code beans} package
 * and is being honored by standalone {@link ListableBeanFactory} implementations,
 * not just in an {@link com.rocket.summer.framework.context.ApplicationContext} environment.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> If you intend to start/manage asynchronous tasks, preferably
 * implement {@link com.rocket.summer.framework.context.Lifecycle} instead which offers
 * a richer model for runtime management and allows for phased startup/shutdown.
