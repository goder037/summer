/**
 * Indicates that a component is only eligible for registration when all
 * {@linkplain #value specified conditions} match.
 *
 * <p>A <em>condition</em> is any state that can be determined programmatically
 * before the bean definition is due to be registered (see {@link Condition} for details).
 *
 * <p>The {@code @Conditional} annotation may be used in any of the following ways:
 * <ul>
 * <li>as a type-level annotation on any class directly or indirectly annotated with
 * {@code @Component}, including {@link Configuration @Configuration} classes</li>
 * <li>as a meta-annotation, for the purpose of composing custom stereotype
 * annotations</li>
 * <li>as a method-level annotation on any {@link Bean @Bean} method</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>If a {@code @Configuration} class is marked with {@code @Conditional},
 * all of the {@code @Bean} methods, {@link Import @Import} annotations, and
 * {@link ComponentScan @ComponentScan} annotations associated with that
 * class will be subject to the conditions.
 *
 * <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Inheritance of {@code @Conditional} annotations
 * is not supported; any conditions from superclasses or from overridden
 * methods will not be considered. In order to enforce these semantics,
 * {@code @Conditional} itself is not declared as
 * {@link java.lang.annotation.Inherited @Inherited}; furthermore, any
 * custom <em>composed annotation</em> that is meta-annotated with
 * {@code @Conditional} must not be declared as {@code @Inherited}.
