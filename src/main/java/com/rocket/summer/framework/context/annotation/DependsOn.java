/**
 * Beans on which the current bean depends. Any beans specified are guaranteed to be
 * created by the container before this bean. Used infrequently in cases where a bean
 * does not explicitly depend on another through properties or constructor arguments,
 * but rather depends on the side effects of another bean's initialization.
 * <p>Note: This attribute will not be inherited by child bean definitions,
 * hence it needs to be specified per concrete bean definition.
 *
 * <p>May be used on any class directly or indirectly annotated with
 * {@link org.springframework.stereotype.Component} or on methods annotated
 * with {@link Bean}.
 *
 * <p>Using {@link DependsOn} at the class level has no effect unless component-scanning
 * is being used. If a {@link DependsOn}-annotated class is declared via XML,
 * {@link DependsOn} annotation metadata is ignored, and
 * {@literal <bean depends-on="..."/>} is respected instead.
