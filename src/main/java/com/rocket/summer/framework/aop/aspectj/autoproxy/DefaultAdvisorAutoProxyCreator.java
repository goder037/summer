 * of this type in the same factory - by setting the {@code usePrefix} property to true,

 * name followed by a dot (like "aapc.") will be used. This default prefix can be changed
 * from the bean name by setting the {@code advisorBeanNamePrefix} property.
 * The separator (.) will also be used in this case.
